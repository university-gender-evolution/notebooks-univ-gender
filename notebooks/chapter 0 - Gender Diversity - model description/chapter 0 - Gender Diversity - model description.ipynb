These shares are represented by $q^r \\in [0,1]$. For example a department may be composed of 20% Assistant professors, 15% Associate professors, and 65% full professors in a given year.

The number of FTE vacancies in a department is based upon the difference between the current number of professors and the target number of professors. If the department is under its target size, then the department will choose to add additional faculty until the current number equals the target number. Of course there is no guarantee that all vacancies will be filled within a single year, as availability of suitable candidates and other factors may limit the total number of hires. Formally, the number of vacancies in the department is:\n",

Instead, the department would simply stop hiring until the department size fell below the target again. \n",

    "### Multinomial Hiring Process\n",
    "We model hiring as a multinomial probabilistic process where all of the vacancies are filled by a mix of assistant, associate, full professors, or are left unfilled based upon a probability for each outcome. The multinomial distribution generalizes the binomial distribution. Formally the definition of the multinomial distribution is that \"it models the probability of counts for rolling a k-sided dice n times.\"[Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution]. For example, suppose we have a die with six sides and a $\\frac{1}{6}$ probability of getting any value between 1 and 6. If we rolled this die 1 time, we might get a vector such as [0,0,1,0,0,0] meaning that the die roll yielded a 3. Each roll will yield a different result, and the next roll might yield a value of 1 with corresponding vector [1,0,0,0,0,0]. When we sum the number of times we obtained each value after 10 rolls, we could obtain a vector like [1,1,3,2,2,1]. This final vector of counts after $k$-rolls is what the multinomial distribution yields, namely the probability distribtion over this final set of category counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our model there is a probability over the hiring of professors at each level at each time step. These probabilities vary with time, depending on professor demand--as I explain below. The probability of hiring a professor at rank $r$, gender $g$ at time $t$ is $p^r_g(t)$ Using these hiring probabilities, we can generate a random draw from the multinomial distribution. The rather ugly looking multinomial density function for professor hiring is:\n",

    "### Professor Demand functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The hiring probability for each profesor group $p^r_g(t)$ is associated with demand for professors at that level. Most new hires occur at the Assistant professor level. These professors have the lowest salaries by virtue of their junior position, and also because they have not yet achieved tenure. Hiring Associate or Full professors, while possible, is less frequent due to the higher cost. One challenge that departments may face is that over time the distribution of professors at all ranks may vary due to retirements of full professors and hires of Assistant professors. While promotions from junior to senior ranks may alleviate some of these distributional changes, the promotion of professors from the Assistant rank to the Associate rank is understandably slow due to the awarding of tenure. Our model privileges hiring at the Assistant professor level, but does not preclude hiring at higher levels. Hiring at higher ranks is more likely when a large number of vacancies occur, for example a high number of retirements in a given year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relative demand for professors at each rank is modelled with a demand function $\\lambda^r_g(t)$. The higher the demand function, the greater the demand for hiring faculty at that rank and gender.

This base rate, $\\bar{\\alpha}^r_g \\in [0,1]$. The second term, $\\gamma \\cdot f(\\cdot)$, is an inflation/deflation factor related to how far the department is from its target size. If the department is above/below target then there is a reduced/increased demand for professors.
