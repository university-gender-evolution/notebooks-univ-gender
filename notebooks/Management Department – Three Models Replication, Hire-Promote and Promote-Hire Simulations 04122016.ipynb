    " TO DO:\n",
    " 1.  Correct Model 3 information.  Right now, the text is just a copy of Model 2.  I couldn't remember what we did   for Model 3.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 2.  Add probabilities.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 3.  I was unclear when I said I wanted counts.  I only need the total Faculty N (average, range) for each figure.  The y axis should still be proportions, i.e. 0.xx, 0.yz etc. (Krishna) \n",
    " 4.  Add decision rule we ended up with for faculty size used for Models 2 & 3.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 5.  When I ask Jupyter to make a .pdf copy, FILE>DOWNLOAD AS>PDF FILE VIA LATEX, the progam doesn't recognize any end-of-page information.  For instance, the text stops just before the first paragraph of Model 2, paragraph 1.  This is obviously not good.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 6.  Fix Figure 1.  It now has an error in it and doesn't show up.  I don't remember changing anything(?)  (Krishna)\n",
    " 7.  Check all the baseline rates in tables.  I think some of them are wrong.  (Barbara)\n",
    " 8.  Add an explanation of error distributions (shaded areas).\n",
    " 9.  Re: Models 2 and 3.  Add decision rule for increasing or decreasing faculty size to text.  There will be two explanations, one for the replication model, which I believe conserves faculty numbers overall, and one for models 2 and 3, which allows a range of size.  I vaguely recall but don't remember the specifics. ADD DECISION RULE TO TEXT.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 10.  Add horizontal lines to plots that show the goal for proportion women.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 11.  Probability results should be included with each set of results.  In other words, the probability of achieving the results should appear with 1.3.2, and then separately for 1.3.3 and 1.34.  I don't know what these are going to look like yet, so we'll have to figure out how they will fit in after we can see what they look like.  (Krishna)\n",
    " 12.  Fix ToC so it matches the outline below.  (Krishna)  I didn't do this because I don't know enough html to edit it.\n",
    " 13.  Figure out how to add an empty line.\n",
    " 14.  Figure out how to add two spaces or use tabs.\n",
    " \n",
    " QUESTIONS:\n",
    " 1.  Is there a simple way to change the color and size of text?\n",
    " 2.  The results suggest several patterns... [**HOW MANY**]  It seems as if it's only one, i.e. the effect of approaching 0 faculty in any level.  Number two might be effects of the overall promotion probabilities relative to the overall hiring probabilities over time(?)  Right now this doesn't provide those overall probabilities.\n",
    " 3.  From what I understand now, we can't really test a promotion probability sweep with the replication model because a. it specifies that hiring comes before promotions, thus promotion probabilities are what's left over rather than a sweep, and b. total faculty N is conserved.  Is that correct?  [WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT I COULDN'T WRITE IT, WHICH MEANS I MUST NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ANSWERS.]\n",
    " 6.  \"This analysis provides a vanilla outlook on all 3 models with the data maintained intact.\" [Does this mean there are no changes in the original hiring and attrition rates for Model 1 and no changes in original hiring, promotion and attrition rates for Models 2 & 3? Is this correct?  In addition it means that the number of faculty is not conserved in any of the three models?  \n",
    " 7.  I assume that once the tables get translated into LaTex, I'll be able to format them better (i.e. merging cells, etc.)  Is that right?\n",
    " 8.  How many times is the simulation being run?  Where can I change the number of years?  Where do I find that info?  I assume at the end somewhere?  [NEED TO SPECIFY LOCATION IN CODE BETTER]\n",
    " 9.  DONE.  Wouldn't it be more accurate to give the promotion rate for the level below, i.e. the promotion rate for female assistants = 0.0555, instead of the promotion rate for female associates = 0.0555?\n",
    " 10.  Which model, i.e. replication, promote-hire, hire-promote, do the sweeps use?\n",
    " 11.  Under Management Department:  How do I get it to move to the next line without adding another space between each?"

    "## 1.2   Model Specifications\n",
    "The analysis shows three simulation models.  All use the department's actual hiring, promotion and attrition rates.  Each requires that the number of faculty is an integer value rather than a fractional one.  Replacements in all models are selected using a cascade that begins with full professor.  The models differ in how they incorporate promotion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision rule when rates produce fractional faculty.  The department's hiring, attrition and promotion rates result in many fractional faculty at the end of each year.  For instance, if the hiring rate for female assistant professors is 0.25, then if there are five hires, 1.25 of them should be women.  However, because of the integer requirement, the model needs to decide whether to hire one or two women.  The decision rule is 1) round the fraction down to the nearest integer, 2) randomly select a number from a uniform distribution and 3) hire two women if the random numbers falls below the hiring rate for that year and hire one if the random number falls above. This decision rule is used every time a fractional faculty member results.  This means it is applied separately to women and to men at each career level and for each of the three rates (hiring, attrition and promotion).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 1:  Replication.** This model is a stochastic version of the original model.  It is a replication in that it uses the original model's hiring and attrition rates as well as its' assumptions about how replacements are filled.  Similar to the original model, actual promotion rates are not incorporated and change each year.  They are set using the percentage of female assistant and associate faculty the year before the promotion.  Different from the original model, the replication counts faculty using integers rather than fractions.  The decision rule for promotions maintains roughly the same number of faculty at each career level throughout the simulation.\n",

    "### 1.3.4 Discussion  [ALL OF THIS WILL NEED TO BE REWRITTEN]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the promote-hire and hire-promote models is very similar except for male associate professor. At level 1, both models have to hire men/women because there is no promotion into level 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Replication model\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication model, which is a promote-hire model that doesn't include actual promotion rates, shows a decline in the number of male assistants as they are promoted to associate. We don't see a lot of growth in assistants for either men or women because in this model all vacancies arise at the top and trickle down. Hence there are likely only a few vacancies if any offered to assistants, and even then there is almost a certainty of hiring men given a probability of 83%. Since there is very little likelihood for women to enter at this level [WHICH ONE?], the number of female assistants dwindles over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior at level 2 is especially interesting. Because the probability of promotion from level 1 to 2 is lower than the probability of promotion from level 2 to 3, any woman entering level 2 is likely to be promoted after a few years. However, as women are promoted into level 3, not enough women are promoted out of level 1 to take their place. Hence over time the number of level 2 women shrinks towards zero. When the number of females at level 2 hits zero, then women who leave level 3 due to attrition cannot be replaced by other women--since there are none. The dearth of women at level 2 leads to more men being promoted from 2 to 3--thus leading to a shrinkage of men at level 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**One challenge with this model is that the promotion rate is variable, based on the proportion of women at each level. As the number of female associates falls, this makes the promotion rate [OR NUMBER OF?] of female associates smaller and smaller. An appropriate alternative would be to use the same promotion rate for men/women as the hire-promote model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promote-hire model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Promote-hire fp model essentially follows the same pattern as the Replication model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hire-promote model\n",
    "\n",
    "The hire-promote model seems to work well for men, especially at level 2. The chances of a man being hired are always better for hiring versus promotion--as per the tables above. Hence the hire first model allows more men to be hired, especially at level 2. Women have a better chance of being promoted to level 3 from level 2, so this allows some accumulation of men at level 2. Once the number of women at level 2 falls to zero, the accumulation of men flattens as only men can now be promoted from level 2 to 3. "
