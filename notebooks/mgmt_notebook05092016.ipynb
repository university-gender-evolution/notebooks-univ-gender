    "This chapter uses historical data on attrition, hiring and promotion.  It includes four stochastic simulations:  two Hire-Promote models, in which hiring is done before promotions, and two Promote-Hire models, in which promotions are done before hiring.  Appendix A includes two replication models.  The first replicates the original mathematical model and the second presents a first step towards the stochastic simulations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data for these analyses come from the faculty personnel office of a university in the Western United States.  Eight years of faculty data were obtained, 2004-05 through 2012-13.  The data follow the attrition, hiring and promotion of each full-time ladder faculty member.  Attrition includes all faculty who leave for any reason.  Hiring includes faculty hired externally for assistant, associate and full professor positions.  Promotions include faculty who move from Assistant to Associate Professor or from Associate to Full professor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attrition, hiring and promotion rates are averages of the yearly changes in the proportion of women and men by level.  For each year, this represents one transition, the instantaneous time between the end of one year and the beginning of the next.  If there are four years of data, for instance, there are three transitions: one between years 1 and 2, one between years 2 and 3 and one between years 3 and 4.  The average of these three transitions is the rate.  Thus, if 10 of 50 male Full Professors leave after year one (.20), 8 of 40 male Full Professors leave after year two (.16) and no male Full Professors leave at the end of year three (.00), the average attrition rate for male Full Professors is: (0.20+0.16+0.00)/3 = 0.12. The actual rates reported below represent the average change in transition rates by gender by level calculated at the end of each year.  CHECK RE: RATES & TRANSITIONS.\n",

In this model, Full Professor vacancies are filled with Associate Professor promotions; Associate Professor vacancies are filled with Assistant Professor promotions.

    "## Replication of Mathematical Model.\n",
    "This model reproduces the original mathematical model (Lawrence & Chen, 2015) to four decimal places (filename).  .  It uses the original model's hiring and attrition rates as well as its' assumptions about how replacements are filled.  The order of change is attrition, hiring and promotion for women, then for men.  Similar to the original model, actual promotion rates are not incorporated.  They change each year to accommodate vacancies that result from attrition and hiring.  Faculty are treated as fractional numbers.  As a result, department size and number of faculty by level do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**  Decision rule when fractional vacancies are replaced by fractional faculty.**  The department's attrition, hiring and promotion rates often result in fractional faculty at the end of each year.  For example, if the hiring rate for female Assistant Professors is 0.25 and five Assistant Professors are hired, 1.25 of them are women.  All fractional vacancies are filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results for the replication model.**  Figure 1 shows the results for Model 1, which is a hire-promote model that doesn't incorporate actual promotion rates.  a for R in the number of male assistants as they are promoted to associate.  We don't see a lot of growth in assistants for either men or women because in this model all vacancies arise at the top and trickle down. Hence there are likely only a few vacancies if any offered to assistants, and even then there is almost a certainty of hiring men given a probability of 83%. Since there is very little likelihood for women to enter at this level [WHICH ONE?], the number of female assistants dwindles over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---- FIGURE A1 ABOUT HERE ----\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior at level 2 is especially interesting.  Because the probability of promotion from level 1 to 2 is lower than the probability of promotion from level 2 to 3, any woman entering level 2 is likely to be promoted after a few years.  However, as women are promoted into level 3, not enough women are promoted out of level 1 to take their place. Hence over time the number of level 2 women shrinks towards zero.  When the number of women at Level 2 hits zero, women who leave level 3 cannot be replaced by other women--since there are none. The dearth of women at level 2 leads to more men being promoted from 2 to 3--thus leading to a shrinkage of men at level 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with this model is that the promotion rate is variable, based on the proportion of women at each level. As the number of female associates falls, this makes the promotion rate [OR NUMBER OF?] of female associates smaller and smaller. An appropriate alternative would be to use the same promotion rate for men/women as the hire-promote model.\n",

Similar to Model 1a, the order of change is attrition, hiring and promotion for women, then for men. Different from Model 1a, faculty are treated as integers and promotion rates for women are set using the percentage of women by level the year before promotion.  Thus, the promotion rate for female Assistant Professors at the end of a year is the proportion of female Assistant Professors the year before the promotion.  Rates for female Associate Professors are set similarly.  Promotion rates for men equal 1-promotion rates for women.  Because faculty are treated as integers, fractional vacancies remain unfilled.  These are replaced by hiring one or two women using the decision rule below.  As a result, department size and the number of faculty by level never increases but may decrease.  \n",

This decision rule is applied to the results for women and men at each career level and for each of the three rates (hiring, promotion and attrition) [CONFIRM THAT THIS IS DONE FOR EACH CAREER LEVEL AT THE END OF EACH YEAR, I.E.BEFORE EACH TRANSITION.] at the end of each transition. \n",

    "REWRITE RULE AFTER KRISHNA FIGURES OUT WHAT HE DID TO MAKE THIS WORK.  This rule applies to Models 1 and 2.  We compensate for this type of situation by allowing the department size to vary within a range.  In some years department size may shrink because of unfilled vacancies, in others the size may grow because of added FTE or department size may remain the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of FTE and the lower and upper boundaries at stake are user-specified parameters.  They are always left- or right-censored by the specified boundaries  For instance, If the number of faculty this year is 74 and a range of 74 to 78 is specified, the change in department size must be between 0 and +4 FTE, with the lowest number of 74 and the highest of 78.  A (0/1) Bernoulli variable determines if each FTE is activated, and another Bernoulli variable determines the sign of the change (+/-).  After the N +/- changes are selected, their sum determines the additional change in department size.  [IN THIS EXAMPLE DOES THIS MEAN THAT FOR EACH OF THE FOUR FTE, YOU SELECT 3 +/-BERNOULLI VARIABLES AND THEN SUM THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER THE CHANGE FOR THAT FTE WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPARTMENT SIZE?]  The model then checks that the new department size is within the defined boundaries. If the size is within the range then the new size is accepted. If the size is outside of the range, the new size is rejected and the process for generating department size runs again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fractional faculty vacancies filled with fractional faculty (department size remains stable).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule applies to Model 3, the mathematical model in Appendix A, which is a stochastic replication of the original model.  It uses the original model's actual average attrition and hiring rates as well as its' assumptions about how vacancies are filled.  Similar to the original model, actual promotion rates are not incorporated.  Promotion rates change each year to accommodate Full Professor and Associate Professor vacancies that result from attrition and hiring.  Assistant Professor vacancies are filled by hiring.  There are no unfilled vacancies at the end of each year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Fractional faculty vacancies filled with integer-level faculty (department size shrinks).\n",
    "This rule applies to Model 4, the first step towards the stochastic simulations used in Models 1 and 2.  Actual average attrition and hiring rates are used.  Demographic change for women precedes that for men.  Change occurs in a cascade beginning with Full Professor and ending with Assistant Professor.  Attrition rates are applied first and then hiring rates.  Promotions are awarded last.  Actual average promotion rates are not used. The promotion rate for women is based on the proportion of women in that level the previous year.  Thus, if 20% of Assistant Professors are women at the beginning of the year, then 20% of any Associate Professor vacancies remaining after attrition and hiring are filled with promotions.  The promotion rate for men is 1-promotion rate for women.  Assistant professor vacancies are filled by hires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the department's actual average rates often results in fractional faculty at the end of each year. For example, if the hiring rate for female Assistant Professors is 0.25 and five Assistant Professors are hired, 1.25 of them are women.  Because the model requires integers, it will hire either one or two women. The decision rule is: 1) round the fraction down to the nearest integer, 2) randomly select a number from a uniform distribution and 3) hire two women if the random number falls below the hiring rate and one if the random number falls above.  Vacancies may remain unfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision rule results in a department that shrinks over time because attrition, hiring and promotion rates are all below .50.  The chance to fill a vacancy is probabilistic.  Thus, if a vacancy is not filled by hiring or promotion, it disappears at the end of the year. \n"
